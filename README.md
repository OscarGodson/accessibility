accessibility
=============

Code samples and documentation for our tutorial "Web Accessibility for the 21st Century".

Contents of this directory are currently:

* booklet: Contents of the handout booklet in HTML format. Attendees will also receive a printed copy, so please don't worry about printing it and bringing it with you -- the HTML copy is just for reference purposes later.

* accessibility_training: These are the sample sites we'll be discussing (and picking apart) during the training. It's a hypothetical page from the intranet of Marvel Comics's Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, otherwise known as SHIELD. (Yes, we had fun with it!)

Please bring a laptop with the code for the sample sites downloaded onto it. If you forget to download the files before you arrive, we'll remind you at the training.
